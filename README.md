## About
Why would I want to make this code?
I decided to make this short code because I see alot of newcomers to Mac and Linux make the same error, putting spaces in their file and directory names ! Since nobody likes to do things manually, I decided to make a code about it! It finds and replaces file and directory names containing a space with an underscore!
